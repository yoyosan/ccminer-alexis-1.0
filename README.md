# ccminer-alexis-1.0

This repository contains x86 and x64 compiled binaries of https://github.com/alexis78/ccminer.

I get 40+ MH/s for BWK compared to ccminer 2.2.4 on my NVIDIA mining rig.

Also, it is the most used miner on the pool I mine, http://bsod.pw/site/miners. Just check for NIST5 - BWK.
